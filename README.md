# Beginner Level

## What is AEO?

AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your website content to be understood and surfaced by AI systems and answer-based search engines, like Google's SGE or Bing Copilot.

### Why it matters

- AI-driven results prioritize concise, structured answers  
- Featured snippets, knowledge panels, and LLM responses depend on clean entities, clarity, and context

## 1. Learn About Entities and Topics

### What is an Entity?

An entity is a thing (person, place, concept) with a unique identity. Google builds its understanding of content through these.

Resources:
- [What are entities in SEO?](https://www.clearscope.io/blog/what-is-an-entity-in-SEO)

How to Practice:
- Use [Kalicube Pro](https://kalicube.pro/) or [Google’s Knowledge Graph API](https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph) to explore entities.
- Create a content outline for a single entity, e.g., “Standing Desk,” with supporting topics like benefits, setup, and ergonomics.

## 2. Understand How LLMs Consume Content

### What is AI SEO or AIO or AEO or GEO?

AI SEO is about structuring content that is understandable by large language models and provides clear, factual, structured answers.

Resources:
- [How to optimize content for AI answers (Surfer SEO)](https://www.icecubedigital.com/blog/seo-revolution-2025-integrating-aio-geo-aeo-sxo-for-explosive-growth/)

How to Practice:
- Prompt ChatGPT with a blog post and ask:  
  "Summarize this blog as a list of key takeaways."  
- Then follow up with:  
  "What’s unclear or missing in this article?"

## 3. Get Comfortable With Structured Data

### What is Structured Data?

Structured data (such as JSON-LD from Schema.org) helps search engines and AI systems understand your content programmatically.

Resources:
- [Google: Introduction to Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data)
- [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
- [Merkle's Schema Generator](https://technicalseo.com/tools/schema-markup-generator/)

How to Practice:
- Add FAQPage schema to a blog post.
- Test your markup using the [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)

# Intermediate Level

## 4. Build Content That Answers, Not Just Describes

### What is Answer-Driven Content?

Answer-driven content is structured to directly answer user queries clearly and briefly. An Ideal way for featured snippets, voice search, and AI summaries.

Resources:
- [AlsoAsked.com](https://alsoasked.com/)

How to Practice:
- Choose a topic like "Standing desk benefits"
- Create a blog post with H2 headings that ask questions (e.g., "What are the health benefits of a standing desk?"), followed by direct answers.
- Add FAQ schema to the page.

---

## 5. Optimize Internal Linking and Semantic Context

Resources:
- [Guide to Topical Authority](https://ahrefs.com/blog/topical-authority/)
- Screaming Frog or Sitebulb for crawling and finding orphaned pages

How to Practice:
- Audit your internal links. Add contextual links with clear anchor text between semantically related content.
- Example: "See our ergonomic posture guide" linking to `/ergonomic-posture`

# Advanced Topics

## 6. Analyze Content for AI Compatibility

How to Practice:
- Ask Bing Copilot or ChatGPT:  
  "What are the key facts you can extract from [your URL]?"
- Then ask:  
  "Would this content appear in an AI summary or featured snippet? Why or why not?"

Tools:
- ChatGPT, WebPilot plugin, Bing Copilot

---

## 7. Monitor and Iterate

Tools:
- Google Search Console
- SurferSEO or Frase for optimization feedback
- Semrush or Ahrefs for keyword and SERP visibility tracking

How to Practice:
- Submit updated structured content to Search Console for reindexing.
- Track changes in impression and click trends from featured snippets or rich results.

## NEW: Section on Google Search Console

### What is Google Search Console?

Google Search Console is a free tool from Google that lets website owners monitor indexing, fix site issues, submit sitemaps, and analyze search performance.
